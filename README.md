# SudokuSolver

## How it works
This program uses a backtracking algorithm to solve the Sudoku puzzle this is a brute force method of solving a Sudoku puzzle there is more efficient ways of it working such as using a constraint based programming language. A backtracking algorithm designed to solve Sudoku puzzles works by trying numbers in empty spots until there arent anymore possible numbers it then backtracks and tries other numbers in the slots before until it reaches a valid grid where none of the numbers conflict.

## How to use

To represent the Sudoku puzzle you wish to solve input the numbers in their relevant positons into the array declared as grid and then simply run the program using the command `python filename.py`

## Python Libraries
Make sure you have Numpy installed if you don't, run the command: `pip install numpy`
